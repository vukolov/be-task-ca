1. Why can we not easily split this project into two microservices?
First of all this project works with tight related entities like Customers and Products. If we split this projects into two microservices we would have a lot of duplicated code.
2. Why does this project not adhere to the clean architecture even though we have separate modules for api, repositories, usecases and the model?
Despite the spliting on a separate models the project still has no separation in abstract layers. For example, the usecases layer has a direct dependency on the repositories layer. This is a violation of the clean architecture.
